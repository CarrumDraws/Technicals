Experiment B has a Mover div track the position of the mouse, from anywhere on the screen.

Transforms are relative to the original position
i.e. Transforming Mover 50px and then transforming Mover 0px puts Mover back in its og position.

Solution: I need to reference the OG position of the element when making transforms, NOT the transformed position. 
Use an Anchor element: A duplicate 'ghost' of the Mover, that doesn't move, to decide our transforms.
