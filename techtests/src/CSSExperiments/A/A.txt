Experiment A translates a Mover Element to the position of a Target Element ONCE.

getClientBoundingRect() works on translated elements, meaning...
    - If target is translated, it is still a valid target
    - Mover DOESN'T work multiple times, as there is no Anchor 

You should track when...
    - Window Resized
    - Location of Mover or Target changes

Things I'd Like --
1. Laggy Tracking: Track Slower (Done!)
2. Bouncy Tracking: Track bounces when moved

ISSUES -- Track only works once, since there is no Anchor element
