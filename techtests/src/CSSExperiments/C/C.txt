Experiment C has a div track the position of the screen when clicked- essentially making the div sticky and centered.

Similar to Experiment B- Differences being the scrollevent is conditional and the size of the Mover changes when active.

Conditional ScrollEvent :
Listener only has access to initial state.
To solve this, use Refs (bruh huh?)

Resizing Mover :
'mover.scrollHeight/2' won't work- the values are read before the styles are applied.
You'll have to manually move the element to the position you want it to take.
Our new height is 80vh. We want our mover.scrollHeight/2 to be 40vh. Therefore, replace mover.scrollHeight/2 with window.innerHeight*0.4.


On click element again, it goes back to its OG size. How to remove style...?


Notes: When elements get bigger, their right and bottom coords expand.
